# Duplo Task

This was a task designed for the Mitsubishi RV-2AJ and RV-2SD industrial robots. The task was to program the robot to perform a pick and place move of duplo blocks. We had to define a starting position for the 8 duplo blocks that were going to be moved. We then had to move the blocks through a gate of duplo blocks, and place them on the other side of the base forming a structure.
